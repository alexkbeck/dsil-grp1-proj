# Data Science Innovation Lab (DSIL)
The DSIL at Thermo Fisher Scientific had a mentorship program in which I took part as a mentor. This repo contains the .ipynb files that I used as teaching tools for the mentees. Our project was to gather stock data (US S&P 500), load it into Google BigQuery, and perform data analysis using SQL and Python.
